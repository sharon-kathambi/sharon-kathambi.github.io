<h3 id="about">About Me!</h3>

  <p>Hey!Welcome to my <strong>first webpage!</strong></p>
  <p>I am super excited!</p>
  <p>I am Sharon Kathambi.I am currently a second year student at Moi University pursuing a major in Chemical and Process Engineering.Ever since high school,I have always know I was going to do Engineering because of my love for Mathematics and Sciences but the question always was,which one would it be?Settling for chemical and process engineering was a struggle for me...because this is something I was going to do for the rest of my life(maybe).But after a lot of thinking and consultation i decided to give it a shot and i honestly do not regret my decision.My journey to Engineering is a story for another day.</p>

<div class="Why">
  <h4 id="portfolio">Why programming?</h4>

  <p>I decided to take a class in programming because I wanted to to learn something new.Having have taken a unit last semester in programming,I didnt really grasp the concept because it was mostly theoretical and the world is going tech so i did not want to be left behind.So far I'm loving programming,it might be a little challenging but who doesn't love a good challenge?I believe coding should be introduced in schools because it builds some good attributes like problem-solving and open-mindedness.</p>

<h4>My Interests</h4>
  <p>Most people would tell you I'm a daredevil but I'd like to think of myself as adventurous.</p>
  <p>I believe everyone should live life to the fullest</p>
  <p>Most people would say 2017 wasn't their year but as for me,it has been an amazing year.From skydiving (14,000ft),zip-lining at Kereita,riding the fastest rollercoaster in the world at Abu Dhabi(240km/hr)..it has been an adventurous year.</p>
  <p>From my little intro,you might notice I love adventure but also I love other things;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reading novels</li>
    <li>watching youtube videos</li>
    <li>travelling to different places</li>
    <li>meeting and interacting with new people</li>
  </ul>
